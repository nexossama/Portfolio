Despite the constraint of using only Tkinter for the UI, which resulted in a visually outdated interface, we overcame this challenge by creating custom widgets to enhance the user experience.<br>I was responsible for designing and developing the user interface. To address the limitations of Tkinter, I designed custom widgets using Photopea for their various states (hovered, clicked, etc.) and implemented them using object-oriented programming. This approach allowed us to create a more modern and functional UI while maintaining efficiency and reducing redundancy.",
